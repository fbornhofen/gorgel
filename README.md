gorgel
======

Synthesizer written in Go. The idea is to learn Go and sound synthesis at the same time.

Usage:

    gorgel infile.gorgel outfile.wav

See libgorgel/testdata for sample input files. At the moment, the only supported output format is WAV with one channel and 16 bit sample width.

In the future, I am planning to make the input format more expressive and to add more options to the synthesizer. A GUI and real-time synthesis would be nice as well.
